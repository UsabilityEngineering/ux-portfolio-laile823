# iPad's Special Keyboard

As a student, I am mostly using my iPad to take notes during class. Tablets nowadays have become so popular amongst students because of the productivity boost it comes with. An important thing for a note taking tool like the tablet is its ability to organize and modify at a fast pace. Combined with the apple pen, writing notes on the iPad is a breeze. On the other hand, if you want to type your notes then it isn’t so much of a breeze anymore. 

The iPhone operating system (IOS) has a keyboard that demonstrates a good application of **“Match[ing] between system and the real world”,** from a usability guideline that aids in the creation of applications to be more **learnable**. The interface originates from the common “QWERTY” style keyboards that the majority of people have on their desk. Here is the picture of the iPhone’s keyboard compared to the real QWERTY keyboard.

In phones, it is common to have the keyboard split into two. One keyboard for the letters, the second for numbers and symbols. This is because fitting the standard 104 keys on a screen would be painful to the eyes of a user. And also cramming those many keys will affect the accuracy of typing because it would be too easy to fat finger two keys at once.  Here, you can see the iPad’s keyboard is split into two, like the iphone but the keys shown on the iPad are different. 

When typing in passwords it is common to have to type a symbol or special character especially with the password requirements nowadays. I am very familiar with the IOS keyboard to the point where I don’t need to look at the keyboard when typing. So when I ran into this scenario for the first time on my iPad, I needed the exclamation point to log into my school’s portal. My first instinct was to click on the second keyboard to pull up the symbols & numbers keyboard and click on the exclamation point. But everytime I clicked on the exclamation point it was a comma instead, this is when I noticed the exclamation point was directly above the comma. **Common convention** would tell me to hold onto the “,” key and I can click on the exclamation point from there. To my surprise I only saw an upside exclamation point. Another thing common for keyboards is to combine two keys to get a special character such as “Shift + 1” will give you an exclamation point on a standard QWERTY keyboard. It took me a couple minutes to figure out how to press the shift key. And to my surprise you see the comma disappear and you are left with only the exclamation point.

In conclusion, the new user’s experience with the iPad keyboard is not a good one. In my opinion they should have just stayed with the standard IOS keyboard layout. Or If Apple’s goal was to make the iPad keyboard closer to the standard QWERTY they should have had the exclamation point above the 1 instead of the comma with all the symbols following suit. This would have way better fit the **model image** of the standard keyboard and resulted with a **conceptual model** that was very different from the mental one.
